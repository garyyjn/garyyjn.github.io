Extension of our reality doesn't have to be overnight-revolutionary, instead, little by little, XR will increasingly join with and enhance our everyday activities. I'm doing my part: [XR Lab Assistant APP](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyyaotailwind_wwdc-activity-7205955621790109697-O3_m?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop). [Sharing an Immersive Space](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O_fLPBY9q7QaQM7wFPJomSa7GYDLQzxKhsB7U6rOTgA/edit?usp=sharing). On-the-fly generation of 3-D entities that fits the environment(Demo Inc.). 

Taking software engineering and machine learning contract work on the side. 

Previously, I worked at Mayo Clinic, preforming AI research in AI Pathology, Adversarial Robustness and Transcriptomics. I made several publications.

While studying at Case Western Reserve University, I grew obssesed with the process of solving tough challenges with smart people. I TA'ed Algorithms starting from 2nd year. I started and ran the university's competitive programming team that did pretty well at ICPC. [I was recognized.](https://thedaily.case.edu/undergraduate-gary-yao-receives-cwru-endowed-robert-l-shurter-prize/)

I also worked at Cleveland Clinic on cardiac diagnostic AI, and Tsinghua University on neural network quantization.

An extension on the prototypical shared space we created at VisionDevCamp. I wanted to demostrate that shared entities in the shared space can be interactive. Previously, the fireball demo appears quite magical, but the fireballs don't do anything but fly. In this extension, we can now shared owner ship over an augmented ball, playing catch just like with a real-life ball. What magical things can we toss to and shared with one another?

An extension on the prototypical shared space we created at VisionDevCamp. I wanted to demostrate that shared entities in the shared space can be interactive. Previously, the fireball demo is quite magical, but the fireballs don't do anything but fly. In this extension, we can now shared owner ship over an augmented ball, playing catch just like with a real-life ball.
